<p align = "justify">When talking about blockchains, we commonly think of its applications in the future. “Blockchain will solve this, blockchain will achieve that”. It’s easy to forget that blockchains are already deployed in the wild.</p>



<p align = "justify">Pick an industry, from automobiles to artificial intelligence, and odds are you’ll find examples of blockchains in action. In all quarters and all circles, blockchains are making their mark. Even the US Treasury is<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/more-blockchain-pilot-projects-needed-says-us-treasury-official"> in on the act,</a>  advocating for more pilot projects and test programs.</p>
<p align = "justify">The ‘World Economic Forum’ anticipates that 
  <a href="https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/realizing-the-potential-of-blockchain">10% of global GDP</a> will be stored on the blockchain by 2025. That means the global executives out there are preparing for this seismic shift, and are ready to completely back its implementation. The impact of distributed ledger technology could be as grand as the internet revolution itself.</p>


<p align = "justify">The use cases differ, but the benefits derived from using the technology remain unchanged: transparency, immutability, redundancy and security. In 2018, new blockchain initiatives are <a href="https://www.weforum.org/whitepapers/realizing-the-potential-of-blockchain">launched</a> every day. Here are 50 examples of blockchains in use around the globe.

<h3 class="section-heading">Government</h3>

<p align = "justify">A number of governments have expressed an interest in blockchain technology to store public records on a decentralized data management framework. Blockchain will enable urban and rural citizens throughout Finland to access records.Other use cases include government applications such as education, public records and voting.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Waste Management</h3>

<p align = "justify">Waltonchain’s RFID technology is being used by a Smart Waste Management System in China. Using Walton’s blockchain, the project will enable supervision of waste levels to improve operational efficiencies and optimize resources.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Identification</h3>

<p align = "justify">Zug in Switzerland, known as “Crypto Valley” has developed a <a href="https://www.ccn.com/uport-self-sovereign-identity-opens-to-residents-of-zug/">blockchain project</a> in partnership with Uport to register residents’ IDs, enabling them to participate in online voting and prove their residency.</p>


<h3 class="section-heading">Border Control</h3>

<p align = "justify">At present, passengers on the Eurostar train between the two countries undergo border control checks at multiple points. Blockchain would provide a means of ensuring that the data has not been tampered with and is verifiably accurate.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Healthcare</h3>

<p align = "justify">Medical records are notoriously scattered and erroneous, with inconsistent data handling processes meaning hospitals and clinics are often forced to work with incorrect or incomplete patient records. Healthcare projects such as <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/research/groups/1454/medrec">MedRec</a>  are using the blockchain as a means of facilitating data sharing while providing authentication and maintaining confidentiality.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Enterprise</h3>

<p align = "justify">Clients of Microsoft Azure Enterprise can access the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/ethereum-blockchain-as-a-service-now-on-azure/">Ethereum Blockchain as a Service</a> . This provides businesses with access to smart contracts and blockchain applications in a secure hosted environment.
  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/google-is-said-to-work-on-its-own-blockchain-related-technology">Google </a> is also reported to be working on a proprietary blockchain to support its cloud-based business. Parent company Alphabet is developing a distributed ledger that third parties will be able to use to store data, believed to be in regards to Google’s cloud services for enterprises, with a white label version for companies also in the works.</p>

  <h3 class="section-heading">Medical</h3>

<p align = "justify">Medical centers that have digitized their patient records don’t distribute their data across multiple facilities, instead keeping them on-site on centralized servers. These are a prime target for hackers, as evidenced by the ransomware attacks that struck NHS hospitals in the UK. Even if security risks are overlooked, there is still the problem of fragmentation. There are currently more than 50 different electronic healthcare record (eHR) software systems that operate in different hospitals, often with dozens of different packages within the same city. These centralized systems do not interoperate with one other and patient data ends up scattered between disparate centers.
</p> 
<p align = "justify"> life-and-death settings, the lack of reliable data and sluggish interfaces may prove devastating. Patient privacy is maintained on a secure decentralized network where access is granted to only those who are medically authorized and only for the duration needed.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Music</h3>

<p align = "justify"> One of the main benefits of blockchain technology is the way it removes intermediaries or middlemen. The music business is a prime example of an industry whose inefficiencies have seen artists poorly remunerated for their efforts. A number of blockchain-based projects have sprung up seeking a fairer deal for music creators, including Artbit <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/guns-n-roses-drummer-uses-crypto-to-change-music-industry/">Artbit  </a> , overseen by former Guns N Roses drummer Matt Sorum.</p>
<h3 class="section-heading">Carbon Offsets</h3>
<p align = "justify">A heavily industrialised nation, China’s environmental footprint is substantial. In March 2017, IBM launched the  <a href="https://btcmanager.com/ibm-launches-carbon-credit-management-using-hyperledger-fabric-blockchain/">Hyperledger Fabric </a>blockchain in conjunction with Energy-Blockchain Labs, as a means of tracking carbon assets in China. This creates a measurable and auditable system for tracking emissions, and facilitates a tradable market for companies seeking to offset their energy consumption whilst incentivizing greener industrial practises.</p> 

<h3 class="section-heading">Supply Chains</h3>

<p align = "justify">chain management is seen as one of the most beneficial use cases for blockchain, as it’s ideal for industries where goods are passed through various pairs of hands, from beginning to end, or manufacturer to the store . IBM and Walmart have teamed up to launch Blockchain  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2017/12/14/ibm-walmart-launching-blockchain-food-safety-alliance-in-china-with-fortune-500s-jd-com/#4b8f1e287d9c">Food Safety </a>Alliance in China. The project, run in conjunction with Fortune 500 company JD.com, is designed to improve food tracking and safety, making it easier to verify that food is safe to consume.</p>
<p align = "justify">China is proving to be a ripe test bed for blockchain projects, for it’s also home to the world’s first <a href="https://www.allaboutfeed.net/Raw-Materials/Articles/2018/1/Blockchain-used-to-sell-soybeans-to-China-239426E/">agricultural commodity blockchain </a>. Louis Dreyfus Co, a major food trader, has set up a project with Dutch and French banks which are used for selling soybeans to China, with transactions settled quicker than traditional methods thanks to the use of blockchain technology.
</p> 
<h3 class="section-heading">Diamonds</h3>

<p  align = "justify"> <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/blockchain-technology-track-authenticate-diamonds/41525/">a De Beers Group </a>, the world’s most famous diamond company, now has its own blockchain up and running, designed to establish a “digital record for every diamond registered on the platform”. Given concerns about the source of diamonds, and the ethics concerning their country of origin, coupled with the risk of stones swapped for less value ones along the line, blockchain is a natural fit. Because each record is indelible, it will ensure that data for each stone lasts as long as the diamonds themselves.</p> 
<h3>Real Estate</h3> 
<p  align = "justify">Ukraine holds the honor of becoming the first nation to use blockchain to facilitate a property deal. A property in Kiev was sold by prominent cryptocurrency advocate and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington. The deal was enabled with the aid of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and is intended to be the first of many completed by  <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/blockchain-sell-real-estate-first-time-ethereum-682982">Propy </a>, a startup specializing in blockchain-based real estate deals.</p> 
<h3>Fishing Industry</h3> 
<p  align = "justify">Blockchain is now being used to support sustainable fishing.

This ‘net-to-plate’ chain allows inspectors to determine whether fish had come from regions notorious for human rights abuses or from countries that are affected by economic sanctions.</p>
<h3>Fine Art</h3>
<p  align = "justify">Similar to the diamond trade, the art industry is dependant on the provenance and authenticity of artworks. While blockchain cannot authenticate a painting to determine whether it is an original or forgery, it can be used to prove the piece’s previous owners. In addition, blockchain is now used as a means of  <a href="https://www.newartacademy.com/blog/2017/12/17/how-blockchain-technology-is-used-to-invest-in-art"> acquiring art </a>. It’s another example of how blockchain technology can be used to make tangible objects easily tradable and exchangeable from anywhere in the world, without the need to physically transfer them from secure storage.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities</h3>
<p  align = "justify">Chile’s National Energy Commission has begun using blockchain technology as a means of certifying data pertaining to the country’s energy usage. Sensitive data will be stored on a blockchain as part of an initiative to help modernize and secure the South American nation’s electrical infrastructure.</p>
<h3>LGBT Rights</h3>

<p  align = "justify">In 2016, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a  <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/homeland-security-to-use-blockchain-in-tracking-goods-people-globally"> project </a> that would use blockchain as a means of securely storing and transmitting the data it captures. Using the Factom blockchain, data retrieved from security cameras and other sensors are encrypted and stored, using blockchain as a means of mitigating the risk of data breaches. The project is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Shipping</h3>
<p  align = "justify" > Blockchain’s suitability to recording shiping data is self-evident. A number of projects have distributed ledger technology to work in this domain, using it within the maritime logistics industry to bring transparency to the unavoidable bureaucracy in international trade. Maersk, one of the largest global shippers, was the pioneer to make use of blockchain and now <a href="https://usethebitcoin.com/start-with-crypto/"> ZIM </a> have picked up the torch.</p>
<h3>Taxation</h3>
<p  align = "justify">As one of the world’s most technologically advanced countries, it’s no surprise China has become one of the first and most prominent adopters of blockchain and everything it offers. It has decided to use the technology to facilitate taxation and electronic invoice issuance in a project headed by  <a href="https://usethebitcoin.com/start-with-crypto/"> Miaocai Network  </a>  in conjunction with the State Administration of Taxation.</p>
<h3>Mobile Payments</h3>
